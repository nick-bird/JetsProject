## JetsProject
This project models a fleet of aircraft within an airfield. The user is presented a menu, and is allowed to manage the fleet, including adding and removing new aircraft. There are 3 different kinds of aircraft which have different functions.

## Topics and Technologies Used
The data for the initial fleet is read in from a text file, and assigned to variables of the correct data type within each aircraft object. The menu continuously loops, allowing the user to select multiple options until they select 'quit'. Each menu selection calls a method which performs a different task. A main class encapsulates aircraft, with inherited classes adding new functionality for different types of aircraft. The user can check the fleet for the fastest or longest range aircraft, and perform functions based on which interface the aircraft class implements.

## Lessons Learned
This project implements OOD to allow the user to interact dynamically with the application. This project was excellent experience in design, requiring multiple classes and objects.  I learned a lot about working with collections of objects, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
